* xref-js2

=xref-js2= adds navigation to definitions or references to JavaScript projects
in Emacs.

=xref-js2= adds an xref backend for JavaScript files.

Instead of using a tag system, it relies on =ag= to query the codebase of a
project.  This might sound crazy at first, but it turns out that =ag= is so
fast that jumping using =xref-js2= is most of the time instantaneous, even on
fairly large JavaScript codebase (it successfully works with 50k lines of JS
code).

Because line by line regexp search has its limitations, =xref-js2= does a second
pass on result candidates and eliminates possible false positives using
=js2-mode='s AST, thus giving very accurate results.

** Requirements

- Emacs 25.1
- `ag' (the [[http://geoff.greer.fm/ag/][silver searcher]])
- js2-mode
